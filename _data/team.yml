    Jishnu completed an undergrad degree in Bioengineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur followed by graduate studies in Computational Biology at Cornell University. After a short postdoc at the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT & Harvard/MIT, Jishnu started his Systems Immunology lab. His most important role is that of a “translator" of jargon across disciplines (comp bio, basic and translational clinical immunology); this helps bridge the interdisciplinary expertise in the lab.
